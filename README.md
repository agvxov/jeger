# JÃ«ger
A regex engine.

### Syntax
The aim was to follow Vim's regex syntax. Esoteric special characters such as "\zs" are not implemented, however the just is supported.

```C
match_t * regex_match(const regex_t * const regex, const char * const string, const bool start_of_string);
```
Returns a sentinel terminated array of `match_t` objects.
The sentinel object is defined as `(match_t){ .position = -1, .width = -1, };`.
The position and width of non-sentinel `match_t`s is guaranteed to be => 0.
